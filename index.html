                                    known to millions of Ukrainians, since it was she who,
                                    from the first days of the full-scale invasion,
                                    delivered the most important news to us day and night
                                    on the air of the national telethon.In April 2022,
                                    anya, as part of the team of the public organization
                                    for the protection of animal rights URSA, came to 
                                    the shelter "Best Friends" with the aim of helping
                                    to dismantle the rubble after the arrival of a 
                                    Russian missile. That day, most of the animals in 
                                    the shelter simply burned alive, and the other 450
                                    dogs that managed to survive simply ran freely on
                                    the territory, because the enclosures and the 
                                    fence were destroyed.To be honest, Tanya did not
                                    plan to take a dog from the shelter, because 
                                    her family already had a dog Burya at that time.
                                    However, a long-legged purebred dog with a
                                    tiger color was able to melt Tanya's heart.
                                    "Laughed the most out of everyone and danced 
                                    joyfully despite the grief that befell the
                                    asylum," Goncharova recalls her acquaintance
                                    with Duke."Where there's one dog, there's two,"
                                    the presenter seemed to think - from now on, there are 
                                    two tailed dogs in her family: Burya and Duke.By the way,
                                    Duke became an active volunteer and co-presenter of 
                                    Tanya in the "Goncharova podcast" project.

                                <p class="text2" >The touching story of Nadia Matveeva and her 
                                    long-eared beauty dog ​​Sami is known to many Ukrainians
                                    who follow Nadia on social networks. The presenter 
                                    often shares news from Sami's life.Today, Nadia and Sami
                                    are very happy together and practically inseparable, 
                                    which, to be honest, is a real miracle. After all, 
                                    fate was preparing a completely different scenario 
                                    for Sami."She and her three brothers and sisters were 
                                    dumped in the forest, good people brought food, a 
                                    blanket and a box to the helpless weak tails, in which 
                                    the little one lived for 4 days, until they were taken
                                    by volunteers for respite. Two puppies were lucky right 
                                    away: they were taken to loving families.But Ozhynka and 
                                    her sister Sami fell ill with parvovirus enteritis - a 
                                    disease that kills many animals, especially at an early 
                                    age. The disease overcame Ozhinka, and she died on the 
                                    way to the clinic. However, Sami continued to fight for 
                                    her life in viral boxing. Nadya Matveeva believed, 
                                    waited and contributed to her treatment. A miracle 
                                    happened. Doctors and Nadia cured the dog.Nadia 
                                    Matveeva can safely be called an ambassador for the 
                                    animal shelter! We're not kidding, it's just like 
                                    that: recently, the host also took care of Lucy, a 
                                    puppy who was found in the forest by a caring soldier.

                                <p class="text3" >A black cat with white spots (or vice versa – a 
                                    white cat with black spots) appeared in the family of 
                                    Svetlana Volnova one frosty winter evening a few years 
                                    ago. Svitlana was returning home after filming when she 
                                    saw a small kitten with severe signs of frostbite near 
                                    the entrance. The least that the host could do to save 
                                    the animals was to take him home, to a warm apartment,
                                    at least for a certain time, until he was examined by
                                    a veterinarian."When Kisa entered the apartment, I 
                                    poured him a welcome drink - milk; he sat down by the 
                                    mirror and never left my house again. Three years 
                                    later, Kisa had a wife, Moon. She was also found on 
                                    the streets, in Shanghai, but her situation was even 
                                    worse: she was dying of stomatitis. She had an 
                                    operation to remove all her teeth, and now Kisa has a 
                                    wife who bites him, but she does it gently.In her 
                                    comment to URSA.MEDIA, Volnova emphasizes that 
                                    Taking animals from the street is already a principle.
                                    Why buy an animal when there are a lot of animals in
                                    shelters, and each of them needs a family. It's hard
                                    for animals in the shelter, and even if you want a
                                    thoroughbred animal, take it from the shelter 
                                    anyway, there are plenty of them! My motto is don't
                                    buy an animal, shelter it"
